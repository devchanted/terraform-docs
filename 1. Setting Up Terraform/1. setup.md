# Terraform Pre-requisites

1. AWS Account Credentails with privileges
2. AWS CLI configured 
3. Terraform installed 
4. S3 bucket for terraform state file storage
5. DynamoDB table for remote state lock

## Project Files

- **provider.tf** - Declare which providers they require, so that Terraform can install and use them. Our provider is aws

- **var.tf** – Declare the input variables

- **terraform.tfvars** – used for storing sensitive information like aws keypairs and will add the file .gitignore for not to upload in any common repository.

- **backend.tf** - defines exactly where and how operations are performed, where state snapshots are stored, etc. Used for storing terraform state in remote location. If a configuration includes no backend block, terraform defaults to using the local backend, which performs operations on the local system and stores state as a plain file in the current working directory.

Above mentioned are the mandatory files. Other files we can define/named based on the requirements

## Terraform useful commands



| Terraform Command  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| terraform init  | The terraform init command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times.  |
| terraform plan  | The terraform plan command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files.  |
| terraform apply | The terraform apply command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan. |
| terraform destroy | The terraform destroy command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.|
