# Assume Role with AWS STS

Terraform provides multiple ways for managing aws user credentials . Creating a user with provileged access is not abest practice as the keys associated with user will have privileges for longer time and will need to rotate keys . Instead of access keys with higher privileges , user can use AWS STS service to enable token based access for a specific duration of time . Let's see how we can achieve that 

## 1. Create IAM User

Go to AWS IAM page and create a new user without any permissions

## 2. Create IAM Role

### Part 1
Create an IAM Role with allows user to Assume Role with necessary policies attached. 
1. Go to IAM 
2. Create Role
3. Select EC2 
4. Add policies needed ( EC2/S3 Full Access etc )
5. Give Role a name and Save

### Part 2
Once you create the role, Go to edit trust relationship and replace the *`"Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"`* to *`"AWS":<user-arn>`*
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "<PUT-USER-ARN-HERE"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

## 3. Create IAM policy

Create an policy for STS policy as below

``` 
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "PUT-ROLE-ARN-HERE"
        }
    ]
}
```

## 4. Attach the policy to user

The flow here is User has a STS policy attached which allows access to assume Role and the role has permissions to access EC2 and S3


## 5. Configure local machine 

a) Create a aws profile for the user created using below command and give access keys, secret keys and region
```
aws configure --profile <give-a-profile-name>
```

b) In terraform code folder . use below code in provider section
**provider.tf**
```
provider "aws" {
    assume_role {
      role_arn = "your-role-arn"
      session_name = "any-name-here"
    }
    profile = "profile-name"
    region = "region-name-here"
}
```

# Conclusion

Once above step is done . do `terraform init` and `terrafrom plan`. Terraform will assume the role and will be able to do changes in AWS resources (in above scenario , changes related to S3 and EC2 as we provided only those permissions)
